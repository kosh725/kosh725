## hey i'm kosh.

transitioning into artificial intelligence and machine learning through my masters in data science.

### what i am currently building or doing:

 -> building out my [blog site](https://koshj.net) to document my thought processes on what and how i build things. this is a current work in progress as i setup my infrastructure to host my own content 
 
 -> developing a flutter mobile application for iOS and android since I don't like swift and java. potentially working on getting an MVP built before september for a late december 2024 release 
 
 -> heavily interested in rags and am currently building a few native applications that take full advantage of it. currently in the process of training my own models that fully utilise this
 
 -> currently collecting data, but planning to build a classification based neural network that will run on my raspberry pi. 
 
 -> building out my meme coffee site, where I express how mocha's should be made and where to find the best cafes in australia that produce them. 
 
 -> transitioning from drawing small pixel art pieces to more tradtional 2D evnironment drawings to inspire the development of my untilted indie game that is currently on hold

feel free to reachout to me via email or dm me on [x dot com](https://twitter.com/kosh_py) since i am more active there.
